# Tidal-stripping of Chrysalis

The video presents the tidal stripping process of Chrysalis during a close encounter with Satrun, from our SPH simulations. In this case, we assume Chrysalis has a mass of 2e21 kg and an ice-to-rock ratio of 50:50. The orbital periapsis is 1.3Rs, with a semi-major axis of 200Rs. The upper panels show a cross section of Chrysalis at its center of mass, where red particles represent the rock core, blue particles represent the ice mantle. The lower panel shows the trajectory of Chrysalis with respect to Saturn, which starts at 4h before the periapsis and runs for 50h in total.
